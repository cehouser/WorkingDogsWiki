    <h2> What is a working dog?</h2>
        <p> A working dog is essentially a dog that has a purpose. Working dogs are trained animals that perform a task to assist humans. Working dogs can be found working on a farm, in a hospital visiting patients, or assisting someone with a disability. They can also be seen rescuing people after a natural disaster, or asissting law enforcement with a wide variety of tasks. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Emotional Support Animals (ESA's) are not offically reconized as a working dog as they recieve no training. ESA's are simply pets with housing rights for individuals diagnosed with a mental illness such as anxiety or depression. 
        </p>
        <p>
        ESA's do not have public access and should not be represented as a service dog. Psychiatric service dogs (PSDs) are specially trained to work with specfic mental illnesses or learning diasbility that the owners would not be able to perform without them. </p>
